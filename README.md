# NeuroFlow 🧠🎧

**NeuroFlow** is a browser-based sound generator for deep focus and cognitive immersion.  
It combines **procedural audio synthesis**, **environmental soundscapes**, and an integrated **Pomodoro timer**, all running locally in the browser using the **Web Audio API**.

The project is dependency-free and designed as an experiment in sound design, UX, and cognitive environments.

## 🌐 Live Version

NeuroFlow is available online via GitHub Pages:

👉 **https://wilsonfrantine.github.io/neuroflow**

No installation or setup is required.  
Simply open the link in a modern browser and press **Play**.

---

## How to Use

1. Click **Play** to start the sound engine and focus session  
2. Select a **cognitive profile** to change the soundscape and visual atmosphere  
3. Open the **Mixer** to fine-tune individual sound layers  
4. Adjust the **master volume** as needed  
5. Use the built-in **Pomodoro timer** to alternate between focus and rest phases  

All changes are applied in real time.

## Features

### 🎛 Real-time Audio Mixer
Individually controllable sound layers:

- Atmospheric drone
- Pink noise
- Ocean waves
- Wind and gusts
- Continuous rain
- Dynamic thunder rumbles
- Procedural synth melodies
- Binaural beats

Each channel can be adjusted live via a sliding mixer panel.

---

### 🧠 Cognitive Presets
Predefined sound profiles designed for different mental states:

- **Deep Focus**
- **Ocean Flow**
- **Stormy Cabin**
- **Zen Garden**
- **Beta Boost**

Profiles control volume balance, dynamics, spatialization, and background visuals.

### ⏱ Pomodoro Timer
- Focus and break cycles
- Automatic phase switching
- Audio restarts between sessions

---

### 🎨 Immersive Interface
- Minimalist, distraction-free UI
- Animated visualizer responding to playback state
- Dynamic backgrounds per profile
- Glassmorphism-inspired controls
- Popup-based master volume control

---

### 🔊 Audio Safety
- Real-time RMS level monitoring
- Visual warning when sustained high volume is detected

## Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Animations
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Responsive layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Web Audio API**
  - Oscillators
  - Noise synthesis (white, pink, brown)

## Project Scope

NeuroFlow explores how **procedural sound design**, **minimal UX**, and **real-time audio control** can be combined to create immersive environments for focus and mental flow.

The project is intended as:
- A Web Audio API experiment
- A sound design and interaction study
- A foundation for future expansion (e.g. new profiles, persistence, localization)
